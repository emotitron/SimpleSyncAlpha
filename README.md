# SimpleSync Alpha
NST will slowly be retired as I work on my new Server Authority project, and these assets will become the replacement - as they use the same interfaces and methods as my new development work.

There are two primary components.
[**Download Current Alpha** - Unity Package Download](https://github.com/emotitron/SimpleSyncAlpha/releases)

## SimpleSyncTransform
A replacement for NetworkTransform or PhotonTransformView. Use as you would NetworkTransform.

## SimpleSyncAnimator
A replacement for NetworkAnimator or PhotonAnimatorView. Drag it on to a gameobject where an Animator exists, similar to how you use NetworkAnimator. More instructions to come.

Let me know how these break for you. I would like it to be able to handle all edge cases, so the more ways you can break it... the better.
